Ideas for Dinger stats
Important stats
Win loss season, person
Era player with character
batting average player with character
slugging percentage player with character

V1 win loss starting with most recent season and moving back
what I need
Image at begining to know whos playing
- detect names in overlay
- who is home and who is away
	- not sure if they line this up in overlay may need to look at highlighted batter/captain combo
	- potentially build data set of captain logos to easily see (sure this is online somewhere)
Image at end of game
- potentially detect on thats the game audio
- maybe look at finish screen if they linger on it
- could also parse comentary to see they said won but that may be harder worth looking into if this image processing is harder

Maybe just need image at the end

Process
get list of all video urls for a season (hopefully in playlist)
process each video starting from back to get image at end of game
- whos playing
- who won
loop through videos and get important image
process all images and generate relevant data to save in the database
build UI so anyone can access easier

V2 track pitching
Think this will be easier than batting just tracking pitcher rather than multiple characters (could be multiple pitchers in game but less than 9 batters)
Already know whos playing so get early screen shot of who the pitcher is 
segment innings (started this)
	- audio queues for inning transition
segment at bats 
	- audio queue for out, hit or walk (edge cases, steal, error/bobble, etc)
maybe should just pull in at bat parse here too but maybe not idk using similar stuff and parsing through the video is the hard part
also can use visual queues here 
- ball strike out count
- whos on base

V3 track hitting
- will most likely loop this in with track pitching but we'll see
- also use some version of audio queues combine with visual queues to get confirmation

V4 bit tracker
- will need bigger data storage for this but track all audio from all games
- find common bits I'd like to track
	- Journey of 1000 steps
	- food game
	- I'm calling it
- compile them together
- could also use comentary to confirm game calls but that might be too much maybe only do it if audio and video analysis is still giving problems
- this is fuzzy on how to efficiently search such a large data set, look into tools or other use cases for how to make this easier
