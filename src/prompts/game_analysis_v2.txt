Analyze this Mario Baseball video and extract the following information:

FIRST - Determine if this video contains actual tournament gameplay:

SKIP if the video is:
- Draft/team selection content (e.g., "DRAFT DAY", "Character Steals", "Team Breakdown")
- Analysis or prediction content (e.g., "Analysis", "Who will win", "Breakdown", "Contenders")
- Grudge matches or exhibition games (not part of tournament standings)
- Other non-tournament content

If this is NOT a tournament game, respond with:
NOT A GAME: [brief reason - e.g., "Draft video" or "Analysis content" or "Grudge match"]

If this IS a tournament game, continue with extraction:

STRUCTURED DATA (required):
1) The HUMAN PLAYER names (e.g., Dennis, Nick, Hunter, Jason, Andrew, etc.)
2) The character team names they're using (e.g., Daisy Cupids, Mario Heroes)
3) The final score
4) Which PLAYER won (not team name - the human player's name)
5) Game type: Identify the specific tournament format and phase

IMPORTANT - GAME TYPE DETECTION:

For "Classic 10" (YERR OUT! format):
- This tournament has a unique structure: Round-Robin → Single Elimination Game → Repeat
- Each round consists of MULTIPLE round-robin games, followed by ONE elimination game
- Look for these indicators:
  * Video title mentioning "Round 1", "Round 2", "Round 3", or "Finals"
  * Commentary discussing "elimination", "loser is out", or "YERR OUT"
  * Commentary mentioning round standings or who's at the bottom

Specify the game type as one of:
- "Classic 10 - Round 1 - Round Robin" (for regular games in Round 1)
- "Classic 10 - Round 1 - Elimination" (for THE elimination game in Round 1)
- "Classic 10 - Round 2 - Round Robin" (for regular games in Round 2)
- "Classic 10 - Round 2 - Elimination" (for THE elimination game in Round 2)
- "Classic 10 - Round 3 - Round Robin" (for regular games in Round 3)
- "Classic 10 - Round 3 - Elimination" (for THE elimination game in Round 3)
- "Classic 10 - Finals" (for championship games)

For "Season 10" (traditional format):
- Standard structure: Regular Season → Playoffs → Finals
- Specify as:
  * "Season 10 - Regular Season"
  * "Season 10 - Playoffs"
  * "Season 10 - Finals"

If you cannot determine the specific round or phase, use:
