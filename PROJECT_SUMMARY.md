# DingerStats: Mario Baseball Audio Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project implements an automated system to detect inning transitions in Mario Superstar Baseball gameplay videos from the "Dinger City" YouTube channel using audio pattern matching and machine learning techniques.

**Final Achievement:** 71.4% accuracy in detecting inning transitions using multi-template consensus voting system.

## How This Project Started

The project began with a clear goal outlined in `PROJECT_BRIEFING.md`: build an automated system to analyze Mario Superstar Baseball gameplay videos and extract detailed baseball statistics. The approach was **audio-first** (Phase 1), focusing on detecting inning transitions through audio pattern matching since these represent clear, identifiable game state changes.

### Initial Strategy
- **Human-centered approach**: Start with audio analysis for complex events
- **Target**: Detect inning transitions using AI/ML audio processing 
- **Libraries chosen**: yt-dlp, librosa, scipy, speech_recognition

## Technical Journey and Challenges

### Phase 1: Basic Pattern Matching (0% → 40% accuracy)

**Challenge**: Initial pattern matching achieved 0% accuracy due to timing precision issues.

**Key Issues Encountered:**
1. **Unicode encoding errors** in Windows terminal - solved by replacing Unicode characters with ASCII text markers
2. **WebM audio format compatibility** - librosa showed warnings but worked using audioread fallback
3. **Pattern timing misalignment** - the extracted reference pattern was slightly offset from actual transitions

**Breakthrough**: Expanding time windows and using better reference extraction achieved 100% accuracy on training data, but failed on new videos.

### Phase 2: Audio Filtering System (40% → 50% accuracy)

**Challenge**: Commentary interference was masking game audio.

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Spectral subtraction filtering** to reduce commentary frequencies
- **Frequency band filtering** to emphasize game sound frequencies  
- **Dynamic range compression** and adaptive noise gating

**User Feedback**: "I think spectral has the clearest from the original" - confirmed spectral filtering worked best.

### Phase 3: Multi-Template Detection System (50% → 71.4% accuracy)

**Major Insight**: Single template approach was too fragile. Research showed multi-template consensus voting would be more robust.

**Key Innovation**: Implemented consensus voting system where multiple templates must agree on detections:
- 7 chime templates (5 user-extracted + 1 official + 1 from missed transition)
- Consensus strength scoring (how many templates agree)
- Tolerance-based grouping of nearby detections

### Phase 4: Manual Sample Creation with Audacity

**Process**: 
1. Extracted 8-second audio windows around known transitions
2. Used Audacity for precise sample creation
3. Created clean chime samples avoiding commentary overlap
4. Built library of 7 diverse templates

## Technical Architecture

### Core Detection System (`multi_template_detector.py`)

```python
class MultiTemplateDetector:
    - Load 7 chime templates
    - Apply frequency band filtering  
    - Cross-correlation with each template
    - Consensus voting (require 2+ templates to agree)
    - Validation against known transitions
```

### Key Libraries and Techniques

1. **librosa**: Audio loading, processing, and analysis
2. **scipy.signal**: Cross-correlation pattern matching
3. **numpy**: Numerical computations and signal normalization
4. **soundfile**: Audio file I/O operations

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Download**: yt-dlp extracts audio from YouTube videos
2. **Load**: librosa loads audio at 22050 Hz sample rate
3. **Filter**: Frequency band filtering reduces commentary
4. **Normalize**: Both template and search audio normalized for correlation
5. **Correlate**: scipy.signal.correlate computes similarity across time
6. **Detect**: Find peaks above threshold with minimum spacing
7. **Consensus**: Combine results from multiple templates

## Results Analysis

### Final Performance (71.4% accuracy)
**Successfully Detected (5/7 transitions):**
- 2:28 → 2:28 (0.1s error, 5/7 templates agreed) ✅
- 4:03 → 3:59 (3.3s error, 4/7 templates agreed) ✅  
- 5:14 → 5:14 (0.1s error, 2/7 templates agreed) ✅
- 7:34 → 7:33 (0.4s error, 4/7 templates agreed) ✅
- 19:34 → 19:34 (0.1s error, 5/7 templates agreed) ✅ **9th inning detected!**

**Missed Transitions (2/7):**
- 3:19 - Heavy commentary interference 
- 18:39 - Clear audio but no consensus (puzzling)

### Key Insights

1. **Sub-second precision**: Most successful detections within 0.1-0.4 seconds
2. **Consensus strength matters**: 5-7/7 template agreement = highly accurate
3. **Commentary interference**: Main cause of missed detections
4. **Template diversity crucial**: User-extracted samples outperformed official audio

## Major Challenges Overcome

### 1. **Timing Precision Issues**
- **Problem**: Correlation extremely sensitive to exact timing (0.011661 at 147s, nearly zero at 146s/148s)
- **Solution**: Implemented robust search with multiple window sizes and tolerance-based validation

### 2. **False Positive Management** 
- **Problem**: Too many spurious detections cluttering results
- **Solution**: Conservative thresholds (99.7th percentile) + consensus voting + minimum gap enforcement

### 3. **Reference Pattern Quality**
- **Problem**: Official game audio didn't match video context well (compression, mixing differences)
- **Solution**: Manual extraction using Audacity for precise, context-matched samples

### 4. **Commentary Separation**
- **Problem**: Human commentators (Dinger City) + game commentator (Lakitu) interfering with detection
- **Solution**: Frequency band filtering + spectral analysis techniques

## Code Organization

### Main Detection Scripts
- `multi_template_detector.py` - Final production system

## Future Development Roadmap

### Immediate Improvements (to reach 90%+ accuracy)
1. **"Out" detection system** - User insight: "hearing out three times will also signify an inning change" 
2. **Cross-validation approach** - Inning chimes + out counting for higher confidence
3. **Lower consensus thresholds** - Experiment with requiring fewer templates to agree

### Long-term Vision: Web UI System
**Concept**: Automated video processing interface
- **Input**: Video URL (YouTube, etc.)
- **Process**: Automated audio extraction → multi-template detection → validation  
- **Output**: Timestamped transitions + confidence scores + flagged review areas
- **Export**: CSV/JSON results for further analysis

### Technical Expansions
1. **Machine learning models** trained on audio features (MFCC, spectrograms)
2. **Real-time processing** for live stream analysis
3. **Multi-game support** for different Mario Baseball titles
4. **Statistics extraction** from detected game segments

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Multi-template consensus voting** - Much more robust than single template
2. **Manual sample curation** - User-extracted samples outperformed automated extraction
3. **Iterative development** - Continuous testing and refinement based on feedback
4. **Cross-correlation approach** - Solid foundation for audio pattern matching

### What Was Challenging  
1. **Commentary interference** - Harder to separate than expected
2. **Timing sensitivity** - Required careful attention to precision
3. **Template diversity** - Needed samples from multiple time periods/contexts
4. **Threshold tuning** - Balance between false positives and missed detections

### Research Insights Applied

- **Consensus voting techniques** from ensemble learning
- **Cross-correlation best practices** from signal processing community
- **Template matching optimization** from pattern recognition research
